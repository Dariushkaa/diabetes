This dataset originates from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. Its purpose is to determine whether a person has diabetes based on the provided data. The dataset consists of 9 columns, and one of these columns serves as the target variable, which means it contains the information we want to predict or classify â€“ in this case, whether the individual has diabetes or not. The other columns in the dataset ('Pregnancies', 'BloodPressure' ,'SkinThickness' ,'Insulin' ,'BMI', 'DiabetesPedigreeFunction','Age') are the features or attributes that will be used to make predictions about the target variable.
